This is a travel time calculator for GURPS 4th edition. I've been GMing GURPS a lot lately, and decided to gather my GMing with the need to practice Java. 
The calculation is made considering the character basic speed (first input). Once typed, you can click the "Calculate Distance" button and get the distance the character can walk in one day, in miles. 
Basic walk by the book consider (Basic Speed*10)miles/day. Lurking on the forums I noticed that many people use *5 in the calculations, to add the realism of bad terrain, bad weather, random encounters, fatigues, and so on. 
Although *10 seems to high, *5 is maybe too low. So, for the purposes of this application, the calculation is done by multiplying by 7. 
The second input can calculate how many days a character can travel a given distance, in miles. Note that you need to fill the first input since it needs the character basic speed information in order to proceed. 
There are no rules for hiking as of now. I might add them in the future, and maybe other details.
